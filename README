# Car.py

I am currently searching for a used car in car.gr.

Sometimes you need to search for more than a model when looking for a used car.
Thats why I made this script. One declares the generic filters and then the
models (make, name and registartion year). Once the script has finished VOILA!
A new browser window opens with the results and all the models gathered together.
